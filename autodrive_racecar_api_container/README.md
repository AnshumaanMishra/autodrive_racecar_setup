# Instructions:
1. Clone the repo using
```

$ git clone https://github.com/AnshumaanMishra/autodrive_racecar_api_container

```
3. Navigate into the folder:
```

$ cd autodrive_racecar_api_container

```
5. Run `start.sh`. If you are using a non-POSIX shell like FISH, you may have problems. If you do, switch to bash
```

$ bash
$ ./start.sh

```
4. In another terminal, run:
```

$ docker exec -it roboracer_dev bash

```
Make sure to run this after you get a "Building Complete" message (only for first-time setup)
